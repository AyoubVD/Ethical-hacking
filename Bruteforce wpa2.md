** Bruteforce wifi  **

1.  Navigate to the folder where the .cap file is stored
2.  Convert the cap file to a file that is readable for 'hashcat'
3.  `/usr/share/hashcat-utils/cap2hccapx.bin hack1-01.cap wpa2.hccapx`

4.  Next I'll move my file to my Windows machine, so that I'll be able to use my GPU to brute force faster
5.  Then using cmd I'll navigate to my hashcat folder where i copied the file to
